                            <p>Three years ago, during the heavy rains of May, my Grandma; who was practically my mom, my sister and my good friend died. It was the worst month of my life. I loved her more than anyone in this world, even more than my parents. I used to run and hide behind her when my mom used to scold me. She used to tell her childhood stories and I used to listen to them and I used to feel sad about missing the 1900's. My unforgettable childhood and early teens were spent with her even though no amount of time was ever enough. I still miss her. When you believe everything is finished, it might be the actual beginning.</p>

                        <p>And, the same month I had completed my boards and was taking my long and agonizing vacation. It was time to decide the college. I don't recall how I came to know about Christ University. But, yes that was my first and the only college to apply. I came to Bangalore to attend the interview and I got selected as expected. As Bible says, trust in Christ and I did too, trusted too much that I was sure that that was my day. I think even the college was too Christ-ly, they asked me to pay the fees on the third day.</p>

                            <p>We all have learnt about "Metamorphosis" in our biology subject. The process where caterpillar becomes a butterfly. Life is a never-ending metamorphosis. It is always changing, always transforming. Sometimes a change is followed by positive results, but on the darker side, a metamorphosis can lead to damage or suffering. But of course, it's one's own decision to improve, destroy themselves.</p>

                            <p>My college life is also like a metamorphic stage of my life even though I couldn't conclude whether I am changing into a filthy caterpillar or a pretty butterfly figuratively. In this journey I met lot of people with different personalities, some generous, some irritating as well as helpful, and some very annoying. I was much more of an introvert and felt very insecure about little things before coming to this college. But now, I have changed because living in the hostel helped me have unswerving interactions with people and improved me socially. </p>

Readers can turn this book down if you don't want to know what happened to me was rife with despair and idiocy.

                            <p>Like every other fresher in college, I had few friends from my place where some of them were also my classmates. We had this new friendship thing going on, we had movie nights and other days we shared some stories which were untold before. There was one friend who was from Trissur who changed the story of my life. He said he saw some girl from another class that he found very attractive and would like to date.</p>

I say infatuations are blind and not love, love is more about all-seeing and accepting. He wanted to know more about her, for starters let say he didn't know her name not even the class she was in. All of us teased him so much that he had thought he was alone in this. But as a good friend, I used to support him even though I knew once you get attached, you are fucked up. Some of us guard our heart with everything we have while there are some whose feelings knocks them like a bullet, ready to surrender to the fatal blow of love.</p>

                            <p>Well, the title speaks for itself. It's French, the language of love which translates into 'Love at first sight'. Poets and artists may have sugar-coated the thought of falling in love at first sight so much that we conceptualize love into finally finding The One. What makes you decide to spend the rest of your life with someone does not happen in a second. Beautiful love stories are a work in progress. I am no better, even I believed in The One, the pureness of intention, maybe that's the reason I never found one.</p>

My friend heeding around the corridor to for his ‘The One’ along with me beside him, my eyes fell on the girl in a pink dress. She was so beautiful that I couldn't take my eyes off her. My doe-eyed eyes following her while she walked from one end to another of the hallway laughing at her friend's joke. There were no reservations or second thoughts, the moment I saw her and, in an instant, knew in my bones that she was The One. She had beautiful eyes, the kind that you could get lost and I guess I did. The one thing I can't stop thinking was her smile, the one I saw in her every day. I called her ‘the girl from Mangalore’.</p>

                            <p>The following week I got her number from her classmate, thinking I would start off texting with her casually. But the excitement took me to another level. I picked up my phone to call her. I heard a tight voice over the phone, it turned out to be her mom. All of a sudden, I didn't know what had to be said, I huddled all my idiocy and spoke to her mom as if I called from a call center.

                            <p>I exactly remember that on my birthday I started texting her which was few days after that phone call. She didn't have any idea whom she was texting, she thought I was someone whom she expected to get a call from. We spoke about general things. I tried sharing my stories, but she didn't give any ears to those. Later, when she came to know who I was, she was a little annoyed to the fact that I was actually behind her. The texts became bleaker each day. The fact that someone's effort is the reflection of their interest in you always muddled me. To be honest, I had no idea how a girl's mind worked. We used to fight on things which didn't have any meaning in our lives. I didn't know where my life was taking me or why was I doing all those things, but I was sure that she had something that won my spurs.</p>

                            <p>You might be wondering why it's so soon for a heartbreak as most of the Indian love stories should end with having extremely tragic or fortunate endings, but this chapter is just halfway through the book. This is not about me, but about ‘The Girl from Mangalore’. Let's talk about heartbreaks. It’s hard to wait around for something you know might never happen: but it’s hard to give up when you know it's everything you wanted. There's no denying the pain of a broken heart, but luckily there are ways to cope with one. Whether you're going through a breakup or grieving the loss of a loved one, honesty, compassion, social support and self-care can go a long way toward easing the pain.</p>

                            <p>Now let's get onto to her story. Few weeks before I confronted her, she got a proposal from her friend, I'll call him ‘The Boy from Bengal’. She was happy with the proposal still confused about whether he was the right one. She gradually started liking that boy, while unpleasant things happened during it like she found him dating other girls along with her. Like it or not, she still tried making things right between them. Moreover, she found gross things in his bag and eventually his loathing for her started. She was heartbroken and fixed her mind not to date any person henceforth.</p>

                            <p>She rings me up saying about the things that happened to her in sobbing tone. But, wait. It's been 8 months since I started talking with her - didn't even told me that she was committed to him whenever I asked her whether she was. I understood that people are not against falling in love with someone or boasting about their relationships, but the deeper issue here is that they are paranoid. They are afraid that they would make a wrong decision about one of the most important things in life and end up feeling dejected, disappointed and hurt; this is what scares them.</p>

                            <p>Everybody makes mistakes in this world; it is a fact of life. Somewhere along the line, everybody is going to make a bad decision or do something they knew they should not have. I believe mistakes allow you to learn something from a situation and move on positively and possibly make you a better person. Sometimes, we do not realize we are doing something bad until we get hurt by it or we hurt someone else. If a person goes through life never making one mistake, they probably do not know much about life. Why? Because mistakes can sometimes teach us more than anything else in life. If we were perfect, nothing would make us curious or happy or sad. Mistakes give us more strength and make us stronger. But, what if a person makes the same mistake repeatedly, well he is called naive.</p>

                            <p>After her breakup, I was so thrilled for getting a chance on her. I started talking more often, she talked to me frequently - used to share much of her life story, about her family and all. When she started expressing more openly I started doing things for her like making cards for her, drawing sketches of us, buying goodies and building gifts for her. One of my favourites was the ambigram where when I flipped my name upside down, I could read hers. I told everyone around me that I loved her because I was too proud that I did.</p>

                            <p>Even though I did everything for her, I made terrible mistakes too. I had humiliated her in front of her class. I had broken her leg when she came out with me for the first time, which turned out to be the last. I got too excited that day and I dashed my bike to a truck. I felt so disgusted that day. I took her to a hospital and did her checkups, the only thing which was running in mind was the thought of how worthless and frivolous I was. Also, another day I had a fight with her best friend which made her feel embarrassed in front of them. I understand nobody in life is perfect. Everyone in the world makes mistakes and learns from them. But what do you call a person who repeats the same mistake again and again and makes the girl feel that you aren't the right person for her?</p>

Three years of struggle faded in vain, complete void to my love. This happened recently before this story was recorded. We talked very frequently despite the cheap feats repeated from my side. She used to understand me quite well. She started telling her stories pondering upon the responsibilities she currently had. She started giving me hopes yet she just wanted me to be her friend. But, things changed, I started avoiding her to the fullest. Didn't reply to her messages, nor did picked her calls. Whenever she asked me what had happened, I used to answer her with my silence. Finally, I decided to say goodbye with a note saying "You have no idea how worthless you made me feel. You never made me happy". Reasons unexplained and unquestioned.</p>
