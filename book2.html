                            <p>The actual story doesn't start with my granny's death instead, it started with my birth. My mom was diagnosed with hyperthyroid while carrying me in her womb. Doctors said that the child yet to be born might likely have some disability. Early infancy I was diagnosed with ASD, but that improved drastically by mid-teens. Yet doctors claimed that I was just a late talker misdiagnosed as ASD.</p>

                        <p>My primary school life wasn't much interesting as it should be. I couldn't blend with the students of my class. I don't recall any day I played with anyone of them. I felt everyone around me are just kids and I hate to be in the class with slow and retarded kids. Even though I did exceptionally well in studies, I couldn't find any joy from my life. No one understood my feelings, not even my parents. The only thing kept me going was my craze towards stars and the sky. Every day I used to question the creation and existence of the world around me. My secondary school life was much better because I got new friends who actually respected me for what I was. I learned from them how to live the present moment to the fullest. During my 11th grade, the school titled me as the "Whizz-Kid". Even though my parents felt proud of me, I never felt too grand about it.</p>

                            <p>A failure is not always a mistake, it may simply be the best one can do under the circumstance. The real mistake is to stop trying. I believe it takes a great fall to really achieve the one you want. Just like a storm before a calm, darkness before light, turbulence before quietness, pain before joy, I made sacrifices before the great victory.</p>

                            <p>Astrophysics was the only thing I ever wanted from my life. I had to drop my entire plan by end of my 12th grade. My 12th final grades came very low. I had no other choice but to get into a disdaining college. My second love was towards Computer Science, so I took up CS Engineering.

                            <p>I think it is entirely possible to fall in love with someone you've never met. Physicality is an expression of intimacy - not an indication. True love is possibly the most fulfilling of life's secret treasures but love by a lesser standard is still extremely important for the human experience. The argument against true love is created to comfort those who lack it. Today I believe in the possibility of love; that is why I endeavored to trace its joy, its madness. Love's farthest reach is beyond us, no matter how long we love or how much. It will always remain the mute mystery to whose ecstasy and ache we can only surrender with a yes.</p>

                            <p>I did my schooling in an all-boys school, which was one of the reasons I felt diffident to talk to a girl. Those days Facebook and Orkut where trending so much, so I thought of giving it a try. I and my friends had these weird exercises of checking random ladies on Facebook which few of us thought was feeble. That's how I met this girl in 12th grade, ‘the girl from Allahabad’.  When I saw her pictures, I saw something which I never saw in anyone else, maybe my first. Fell in love with her innocent looking pics. Before you judge me, understand why.</p>

                            <p>The ones who are afraid of heights don't trust themselves enough to jump, but once you are in the air, there's nothing which stops you from reaching the aim. I think that people tend to forget about or ignore the freedom that they have to make choices for themselves and decide what kind of life they wish to live. I can say from experience that I have made plenty of choices based on what I thought other people wanted, and I can honestly say those are the decisions I regret the most. I resent living with regrets based off of choices I made to satisfy other people, I now realize that I have the freedom and right to make choices for myself. I realize that my choices are my own, and I realize that the consequences of my decisions will also be my own, and I will live with those consequences with no regret, and because of this, I will be happy with my choices. Love can direct us to make decisions that we know are not right.</p>

I talked to them as different people, sometimes I was college informants, sometimes her own school teachers, sometimes just as her friend. Came up with the hope that she might choose Christ, cause her previous school was a convent school. If you ask did I manipulated her, I don't know the answer, it's more like I don't want to let it out. Intentionally my finals went bad so that whichever college she opted for, I had to find my way in. My parents were very stringent and little possessive about my future like rest of our parents.</p>

Just two weeks of following both of them I realized that that won't last for long. So, I decided to show love to another person who was already dating, that's ‘the girl from Mangalore’. I had two intentions. Firstly, I didn't know much about girls, the way they act and respond to a particular situation. Secondly, in the means of loving a random girl, I could let my girl know that to what extent I could go in the name of love and to prove that I am capable of loving. I don't have any explanations for the deeds I did, I just followed my instincts, I had my reasons.</p>

If anyone actually loves someone, do they just shout about it to everyone irrationally? No, if you actually love someone you would keep it to yourself. This is the time, I introduced ‘the girl from Allahabad’ to my parents without telling them that I love her.</p>

                            <p>Second-year gave me a shimmer of hope. She broke up with that guy out of the bloom presuming I just got a chance over her again. I made a small pun over her to get her attention which ended with an in-depth and articulate conversation. Wistfully she added that she had vowed to never give her heart to any man like she did before. That caught my mind, and I kept on doing things for the Mangalorean girl on one end and I blustered my deeds to my girl on the other end.</p>

                            <p>The reason why I love her? True love doesn't happen right away, doesn't happen by accident. It's deliberate, intentional and purposeful, but the moment you realize that whatever you have done was worth it, It's complete. It's not just one thing which made me love her, but a series of events which ended up as the reasons for this book. There were voices inside me, these voices whispered to me all day long. I knew that those were wrong, but I felt those were right for me. No one in existence could or should manipulate your decision - just listen to your voice that speaks inside and people call it instincts.</p>

                            <p>I fell for the innocence of her soul which she seemed unaware. The intelligence of hers that made me think hours after her conversations ended. The goodness in her that avoided all the negativity protecting her strength. The way her front hair brushes her face when the wind hits it. The times when she complained about her hair looking messy. The times she hated people taking her pic. The way she rubs her lips. The way she nods her head when she doesn't understand something. The way she corrects her dupatta and pulls down her churidar each time she stood up. The feeling when I looked at her eyes - her eyes are too perfect. The times when my heart stopped when we made eye contact just to sync with the beat of her heart. The way she moves her hands when she wants others to understand her idea. The way she moves her body when she laughs. The times when she gives that look after taking her picture as if she isn't perfect.</p>

It's been 8 months since I started talking with her - didn't even told me that she was committed to him whenever I asked her whether she was. I understood that people are not against falling in love with someone or boasting about their relationships, but the deeper issue here is that they are paranoid. They are afraid that they would make a wrong decision about one of the most important things in life and end up feeling dejected, disappointed and hurt; this is what scares them.</p>

                            <p>Life is a series of experiences, each one of which makes us stronger, even though sometimes it is hard to realize this. Life is too short to waste doing nothing, make every day count because we all don't know when we will leave this world. Cherish the moment you have with loved ones and never regret anything in life, because everything happens for a reason. Every struggle arises for a reason for experience or a lesson. A great journey is never easy and no dose of adversity along the way is ever a waste of time if you learn and grow from those setbacks. Sometimes all we need is a new beginning.</p>

But, I failed, I couldn't prove her that I was different from the rest. She said she was hurt by the people around her; fake intentions and dishonesty broke her heart. I failed to let her know my love and intention were pure as her soul. I couldn't tell her the truth, the truth that all these years I waited for her and things I did were to capture her attention. I was scared, to tell the truth, scared that she won't believe my words and scared that she would call me a fraud. I planned everything, but when I talked with her I lost myself in the wild storm of her beauty both inside and out. I love her so much and I didn't know what had to be done next.</p>

I am here scribbling this dismal literature. I am just so scared to touch her soul only to have taken away again, maybe that's why I pushed her away at the first place and that's why I am so guarded, but I don't think I can ever touch it without her love, and I don't know how she can ever love me at all.</p>

I have been working steadily for four long years. If you think I used the Mangalorean girl, I just have one thing to say. Whatever happened between us, it was her choice to take the call or end it. If you think I manipulated or formed her, you are wrong; I couldn't hurt anyone in the process of winning the thing I want. I never had a proper eye to eye conversation with her nor I ever gave her chance to get attached to me. Yet when things got out of the hand, I messed up a little to prove I was the wrong choice for her. But whatever I did to the Mangalorean girl was never to envy my girl, but to prove that I am capable of loving. I never wanted my girl to love for what I did, instead of for what I am.</p>

                            <p>Life always has an odd way of making things work out in the end. But, this time the odds aren't in my favor. It's hard to believe looking at these pages and realizing that they were complete bullshit; hard to believe this is the end. By the time you read this line, the story of my life will also be at the end. This book doesn't have an ending, not even a happy one. How can a 20-year-old man write the story of his life, when he didn't even live a quarter of whole? Well, maybe the life was too short for him. The retarded deeds have come to an end, his demented and uncanny ways to get a girl's heart failed. This story isn't just a story about winning the heart, but also to show that when you say ‘mad’ love, you can't define the level of madness under a bound.</p>

                            <p>Unless commitments are made, there are only promises and hopes; but no plans. This story is about my failure and it's something for the world to learn from and not to repeat it. If I can love a wrong girl this much, then think to what extent I love ‘the one’. This isn't the end nor the beginning. My life made me think that we're on our own in our life both terrifying and miserable. There are few comforts. One of them is finding ‘the one’. They can make you feel the world is smaller and safer than it really is because you know they had similar experiences. When you meet people like that, you may find your world feels a little more complete, like the missing piece of a puzzle.</p>

                            <p>Finally, what I want to say is that we are all inevitably connected in some way. Every single one of us all over the world. What one person does affect another like dominoes. One of us falls and another follows. And this keeps going and going and going until we've all fallen. And I fell over and over again for this girl and this is what I did FOR THE GIRL I LOVED.</p>
