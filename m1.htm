I understand, but nothing matters at all now. I had only one chance, and I got my answer. In fact I never got one too. It's  just there's no chance for me. Now it's over, since the things which I did were the last thing I ever wanted you to hear. So this is the end. </p><p>

Writing a book was planned before. But I just preponed my plan one year. I have been having this thought. What if I meet with an accident and I lose my memory? Will I remember her coz I only did things for her or you coz you were the one I did things for. I thought that whatever I did was enough. Atleast thought, that I shouldn't be scared to confront you. Started to propose you as if it was a joke and wanted to see your reaction. But the day you said you would have considered if I proved my love was for real, I lost my mind.... I didn't know what have to be done. Prepared myself. Wore sweatshirt for entire winter, ate a bit too much. Told everyone that I wanted to transform (as if for her to reduce my fat), but did the opposite. I wanted to recreate the chance which I wanted in first year. I shaved my beard and change things behind you, which created the same milieu as first year. I know it sounds so insane. But I just had one shot and thought of being completely myself when I did that. Now since I am convinced that I ain't perfect for you, I stopped. And now I wanted you to know the story of my life. It was you the whole time. The days you lived, the days you worried about the things happening to you, the days you felt insecure, the days you felt worthless, the days you were happy.... I was there<br>
... just thinking about you and us.</p><p>

Well, till now you just know what all I did. But you don't know anything much about my life, my past like what I am. Same way I just know your family, and and other whereabouts. Even I don't know *you*, the person behind that face. Yet this mystery kept me going till today. I wanted to know what was happening behind that pensive and charming face of yours. Never had a chance and bewailing for the fact that I never will.</p><p>

I don't know whether you remember. When I first made an "I love you" card. I showed it you. When Stanley told you guys, "if that card was given to any of you, you might just say yes without a second thought.". Well, that statement shook me. In my heart, all I was saying that it is meant for you. I don't know whether you remember our first picture together. It was second year. You were sitting with Ashish Immanuel. Usually I sit in the front row. That day, I came at the back, trying to come between the frame. Well, I got a good picture. Enough to make my life happy. Those are just few things which you could remember, but there are more.</p><p>

I never wanted love. I wanted you. A person whom I think is good at understanding others. A person whom I could share my secrets with. A personality whom I will never get bored of. A girl who I think is more or less like me ... Inside. 

Was I late? Or, didn't I ever had a chance with you?
